### About
The 12th Young Researchers Workshop on Concurrency Theory aims to provide a platform for PhD students and young researchers to exchange new results related to concurrency theory and to receive feedback on their research. The focus is on informal discussions. All topics related to concurrency theory are welcome.

### Format
YR-CONCUR 2024 is a satellite workshop of Confest and will be held on **TBD**, in-person. It is anticipated that many Confest participants will attend the YR-workshop (and vice versa).

#### Abstracts
Presentations are selected on the basis of an abstract of up to 2 pages describing the research or a short abstract of work published elsewhere. Submissions are judged on the expected interest in and quality of the talk. The accepted abstracts will be made available at the workshop, but no formal proceedings are planned. It is thus allowed (and encouraged) to send results that have been published in other venues, as well as unpublished results and ongoing research.

#### In-person
We do not plan to offer a support for remote attendance, unless requested otherwise. In any case, presentations are expected to be given in person, and discussions will take place in situ as well.

#### Talks
We offer the possibility of giving either short or long talks; you can specify your preference in the abstract.
* Short talks aim at giving a quick overview of one of your recent results, to help disseminate and discuss it.
* Long talks are meant to provide a more in-depth presentation of your topic, so that you have time to introduce the relevant notions in an accessible way and to allow for a more precise discussion afterwards.

#### Open problems session
To foster fruitful discussions, we also give space for an open problems session, in which you can present problems that the audience might help you with.

### Important dates
* Submission deadline: TBD
* Notification date: TBD
* Workshop: TBD
