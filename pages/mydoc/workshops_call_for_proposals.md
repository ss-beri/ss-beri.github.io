Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit proposals for **ONE DAY** workshops on topics related to theory, formal modeling, verification,performance evaluation and engineering of concurrent, timed, industrial,and other systems. Typically, CONFEST workshops feature a number of invited speakers and anumber of contributed presentations.

The workshops will take place one day before (TBD) and one day after (TBD) the main conferences.

### Topics
The purpose of the workshops is to provide participants with a friendly, stimulating, and interactive atmosphere for:
* presenting novel ideas,
* discussing their applications,
* encouraging cross-fertilization between industry and academia, and
* fostering opportunities for young and prospective researchers.

### Organisation
CONFEST’24 is planned as a physical, in-person event, with some support for remote participation. In a limited number of cases, there will be remote-participation support for speakers and for other participants who are unable to come. Please take this into account when preparing a workshop proposal and communicate to participants requiring such support that they should contact the organizers of CONFEST explaining their case.

We will provide the following to workshop organisers:
* Meeting rooms on demand
* Coffee breaks, catering for lunch, both are included
* The CONFEST'24 website cannot be made accessible for edits by third parties but workshop organisers can either host their own website and provide a link to it that we put on CONFEST website, or they send us their content and we put it in the website.
* Registration will be centralized by CONFEST. 
* Special rates for hotels, as well as local information, can be found on the [website])().
