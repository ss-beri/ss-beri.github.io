### Paper submission
FORMATS 2024 (22st International Conference on Formal Modeling and Analysis of Timed Systems) aims to promote the study of fundamental and practical aspects of timed systems, and to bring together researchers from different disciplines that share interests in the modelling, design and analysis of timed computational systems. The conference aims to attract researchers interested in real-time issues in hardware design, performance analysis, real-time software, scheduling, semantics and verification of real-timed, hybrid and probabilistic systems.

Typical topics include (but are not limited to):
* Foundations and Semantics: Theoretical foundations of timed systems, languages and models (e.g., timed automata, timed Petri nets, hybrid automata, timed process algebra, max-plus algebra, probabilistic models).
* Methods and Tools: Techniques, algorithms, data structures, and software tools for analyzing timed systems and resolving temporal constraints (e.g., scheduling, worst-case execution time analysis,optimization, model checking, testing, constraint solving).
* Applications: Adaptation and specialization of timing technology in application domains in which timing plays an important role (e.g., real-time software, hardware circuits, scheduling in manufacturing and telecommunication, robotics)

This year, FORMATS will incorporate a special track on:
* Monitoring of cyber-physical systems. We encourage the submission of papers on all approaches related to the monitoring of cyber-physical systems, including monitoring methods, monitoring applications (such as robustness-guided falsification), and related techniques (such as validation of a formal specification for monitoring).

### Paper submission
FORMATS 2024 solicits high-quality papers describing research results, experience reports and/or tools related to the topics mentioned above. Submitted papers must contain original, unpublished contributions, not submitted for publication elsewhere. The papers should be submitted electronically in PDF, following the Springer LNCS style guidelines. FORMATS 2024 has two categories of papers:
* Regular papers, which should not exceed 15 pages in length
* Short papers, which should not exceed 7 pages in length
Both page limits exclude references, which are not limited in length. If necessary, the paper may be supplemented with a clearly marked appendix, which will be reviewed at the discretion of the program committee. Each paper will undergo a thorough review process. Papers should be submitted electronically via the [EasyChair online submission system](https://easychair.org/account/signin?l=neJIAGUNYuaqtJheyBDmcc)

### Artifact evaluation
FORMATS encourages authors to submit artifacts where appropriate, for example to demonstrate how to reproduce experimental data in a research paper or to examine the usability and applicability of a software tool. Artifacts will be evaluated by the artifact evaluation committee and those that are accepted will receive a repeatability badge to be displayed on the first page of the published version.

For more details see the [artifact evaluation page](FORMATS_artifact_evaluation_process.html).

### Publication and best paper award
The proceedings of FORMATS 2024 will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. The best paper of the conference will be awarded the Oded Maler Award in Timed Systems.
