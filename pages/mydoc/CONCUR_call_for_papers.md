### Paper submission
CONCUR 2024 solicits high quality papers reporting research results and/or experience related to the topics mentioned below. 
* All papers must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere.
* Each paper will undergo a thorough review process. The paper may be supplemented with a clearly marked appendix, which will be reviewed at the discretion of the program committee.
* The CONCUR 2023 proceedings will be published by LIPIcs.
* Papers must be submitted electronically as [PDF files via EasyChair]()â€‹
* Papers must not exceed 14 pages (excluding references and clearly marked appendices) using the LIPIcs style.

### Topics
Submissions are solicited in semantics, logics, verification and analysis of concurrent systems. The principal topics include (but are not limited to):
* Basic models of concurrency such as abstract machines, domain-theoretic models, game-theoretic models, process algebras, graph transformation systems, Petri nets, hybrid systems, mobile and collaborative systems, probabilistic systems, real-time systems, biology-inspired systems, and synchronous systems;
* Logics for concurrency such as modal logics, probabilistic and stochastic logics, temporal logics, and resource logics;
* Verification and analysis techniques for concurrent systems such as abstract interpretation, atomicity checking, model checking, race detection, pre-order and equivalence checking, run-time verification, state-space exploration, static analysis, synthesis, testing, theorem proving, type systems, and security analysis;
* Distributed algorithms and data structures: design, analysis, complexity, correctness, fault tolerance, reliability, availability, consistency, self-organization, self-stabilization, protocols;
* Theoretical foundations of architectures, execution environments, and software development for concurrent systems such as geo-replicated systems, communication networks, multiprocessor and multi-core architectures, shared and transactional memory, resource management and awareness, compilers and tools for concurrent programming, programming models such as component-based, object- and service-oriented.

### Awards
In 2024, CONCUR Test-of-Time and best paper awards will be given for the fourth time. The winners will be announced at the conference.
