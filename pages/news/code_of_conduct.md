Our policy is based on the ACM's [anti-harassment anti-discrimination policy](https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/officers-manual/policy-against-discrimination-and-harassment):

The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central to the values and goals of CONFEST.  They require n safe and welcoming environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group. The organization of CONFEST is committed to providing such an environment during the whole event.
